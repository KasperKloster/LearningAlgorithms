## Bubble Sort
The goal is to sort our dataset from lowest to highest number (ascending order).
<br/>
We compare each set in a list. If the first number (left) is greater than the second (right), we swap them!
We move on to the next set. <br/>
If the left side is not greater, we only move on to next step. <br/>
We do this until we reach the end of our dataset. That was the first iteration.<br/>
The we do it again and again and again, until our list is fully sorted.
